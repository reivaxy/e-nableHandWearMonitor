# Fabrication files for 300mAh version PCB


If you are going to use the provided STLs to 3D print the case, make sure to order a 0.8mm pcb

## V2 is the long version.

V2.0 is not optimal for ESP led position, that might be hidden by scratch band when using provided case STL. 

V2.1 fixes that by rotating ESP

## V3 is the squarrish version.
No issue reported so far.
