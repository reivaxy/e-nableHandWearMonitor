Fabrication files.

If you are going to use the provided STLs to 3D print the case, make sure to order a 0.8mm pcb

Several different PCBs were actually made.

PCB V1 is 1000mA version, PCB V2 is 300mA version.

V1.0 is buggy due to incorrect IR detector package. V1.1 fixes that, along with some layout change to ease component soldering

V2.0 is not optimal for ESP led position, that might be hidden by scratch band when using provided case STL. V2.1 fixes that by rotating ESP
