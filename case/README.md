# 3D files for case, lid and clip-on connector

Here are the source files to 3D print the cases for the handmonitor.

The dimensions need to be accurate for the PCB and battery to fit tightly, and the PCB should be 0.8mm thick.

The V1, aka "1000mAh", version is available in 1 layout.

The 300mAh version is available in 2 layouts:

- V2: long case

- V3: squarrish case  NOT READY FOR REAL PCB YET, just a POC

The 3 small holes for the mode and charging LEDs are intended to be filled with a small bit of  âŒ€1mm plastic optical fiber.


# Black well for better results
Ideally, the IR sensor well should be printed in black, to improve sensor levels differenciation between "worn" and "not worn" states.

Using the same elctronic device in the two cases below, the level on the sensor when the device was not worn was twice as high with the black well than with the white well.

When printing a black well is not possible then its inside walls should be painted with black acrylic paint, for instance.
